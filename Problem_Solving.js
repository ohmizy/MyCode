// One of the strategies that I would apply to solve the problem is that I would have the application recognize certain words that fall under each category. For example I, Me, Us and we would fall in First Person. You, Your, Yours, Yourself, Yourselves would fall under Second Person and finally He, She, they and so on would fall under Third Person. 
// I would then create 3 different arrays that contained those words I just mentioned and label them first person {} second person {} and finally third person {} to fit in those arrays. 
// In my opinion the hardest part of problem solving is how long it takes depending on the difficulty of the problem we are being asked to solve.
